Initial Claude Prompt
1. Uses the same color-coding temporal scheme as before
2. Visualizes the GSV pano data taken by Google (so, has copyright_info with Google) as small circles. The circles should be color-coded (again with the same temporal color scheme).
3. Has the same legend in the top-right corner with the color-coded years and, in parantheses, the number of Google panos with that year
4. In the bottom right, has a bar graph where the x-axis is capture_date and the y-axis is the number of Google panos with that capture date. We should adaptively make the bars small if there are lots of bars (down to a certain minimum size). We should also support horizontal scrolling for big bar graphs.
5. The visualizations are all interactive. If you click on a circle marker, all circles taken with the same capture_date should be shown and all others should have their transparency set to something like 0.8. Similarly, support the same behavior in the bar graph (and make the selected bar highlighted vs the unselected, which should have a high transparency). Finally, if you click on a year in the legend in the upper right, we should select all bars and all points taken in that year
6. We need to support loading cities by passing the filename as a parameter in the url bar (so we can share particular url links to cities with others)

Updated Claude Prompt
I want to make a simple web app that visualizes Google Street View pano ages via an interactive map. 

1. The data comes from the url 'file' parameter like city.html?file=pullman_wa_width_10433_height_6383_step_20.csv.gz
2. This csv file format is compressed as a .gz and has the following header: query_lat,query_lon,query_timestamp,pano_lat,pano_lon,pano_id,capture_date,copyright_info,status. A snippet of the data is below my list.
3. The map should be fully responsive and take up the full browser window. It should use folium with a basemap of   L.tileLayer('https://{s}.basemaps.cartocdn.com/dark_all/{z}/{x}/{y}{r}.png', {
            attribution: '© OpenStreetMap contributors © CARTO',
            maxZoom: 19
        }).addTo(map);
4. For each entry of the csv, we should filter to panos from Google (so, copyright_info from Google) and a status === 'OK'. For each pano that passes this filter, we should create a color-coded pano marker
5. Each pano marker should be a small circle and color coded with the following code getColor function pasted below.
6. We should also show a legend in the upper right that has years (like 2022, 2023, 2024) with the same color coding. If you click on a year, all panos with a capture_date year that matches should show up.

function getColor(age) {
    // Attempts to mimic the YlOrRd color scheme from Python branca

    const maxAge = 12;
    const ratio = Math.min(age / maxAge, 1);
    
    // YlOrRd color scheme interpolation
    // Start: rgb(255, 255, 178) - light yellow
    // Middle: rgb(253, 141, 60) - orange
    // End: rgb(189, 0, 38) - dark red
    
    if (ratio < 0.5) {
        // Interpolate between yellow and orange
        const r = 255 - (ratio * 2 * (255 - 253));
        const g = 255 - (ratio * 2 * (255 - 141));
        const b = 178 - (ratio * 2 * (178 - 60));
        return `rgb(${Math.round(r)}, ${Math.round(g)}, ${Math.round(b)})`;
    } else {
        // Interpolate between orange and red
        const adjustedRatio = (ratio - 0.5) * 2;
        const r = 253 - (adjustedRatio * (253 - 189));
        const g = 141 - (adjustedRatio * 141);
        const b = 60 - (adjustedRatio * (60 - 38));
        return `rgb(${Math.round(r)}, ${Math.round(g)}, ${Math.round(b)})`;
    }
}

Gemini Prompt
1. For each row of the csv.gz file (see below), I want to create a color-coded pano marker (yellow for newest, red for oldest) based on years old (float)
2. I also want to make an interactive legend in the top-right corner. The legend should show capture date (in years) with the same color-coding. If you click on a year in the legend, it should highlight all corresponding pano markers with the same capture_date year. Each legend entry should show the year and, in paranthesis, the number of panos corresponding to that year
3. The panos should be filtered to those with copyright_info from Google and status === 'OK'
4. A temporal bar graph should be drawn in bottom right that is also interactive. Each bar represents a capture_date and the y-axis is pano counts for that capture data (again filtered to Google panos only)


I have a csv.gz file that has this format:


query_lat,query_lon,query_timestamp,pano_lat,pano_lon,pano_id,capture_date,copyright_info,status
